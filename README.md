# ResumeAnalysis2025
Here , i am building an ai application that can analyse resume vs job descriptions  and draw insights


- Files that we intend to create are ``app.py`` with another file as ``analysis.py`` that can have the prompts and genai model followed by ``pdf.py`` which will capture the pdf files and extract the resume text.

- ``.env`` to store the gemini api key
- ``requirement.txt` to store the libraries needed for the app.

- activate virtual environment by ``source .venv\Scripts\Activate``
